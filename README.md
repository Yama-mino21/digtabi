# digtabi
DigTABI in HOKKAIDO is a service that suggests travel destinations within Hokkaido based on your mood. We aim to connect you with undiscovered regions, aligning with your desire for healing and discovery as someone living in an urban environment. Furthermore, this service seeks to generate exchange and related populations by attracting people to towns with hidden tourism resources.

We want to energize both urban and rural areas of Hokkaido, and we will achieve this through DigTABI!

This site was created based on the group work (Team 8) from the START UP HOKKAIDO Collaboration Lecture.
